# FluidSim-KinectTD
Interactive Fluid Simulation art installation made with TouchDesigner and integrated with a Kinect v1

The original (without kinect integration) is a tutorial done by threedashes on YouTube which is based on a paper made by Joe Stems [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Spring11/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf) made for game engines.
